 *
 * Why these aren't just the brand indigo/violet/blue:
 * that set fails hard. #818CF8 vs #A78BFA is ΔE 1.9 under protanopia — the two
 * series are indistinguishable to a red-blind viewer. Indigo is kept as the brand
 * anchor in slot 0 and the remaining hues are spread far enough apart to survive
 * protan/deutan/tritan simulation.
 *
 * Slot order is FIXED. Never cycle it, never reassign by rank — a filter that
 * removes a series must not repaint the survivors.
